<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has estimated a 2 m global mean sea level rise for a ‘high’ scenario. By the year 2100, a projected 13.1 million people in the United States alone would be living on land that will be considered flooded with a SLR of 6 feet (1.8). Using small area population projections, the NOAA’s Digital Coast Sea Level Rise estimates, and a machine learning (ML) method for modeling human migration, researchers have shown that the effect of SLR on human populations could be more pervasive and widespread than anticipated, with almost all counties receiving some number of additional migrants due to SLR induced flooding. The areas immediately adjacent to coastal counties will experience the most dramatic impacts as many migrants will simply move slightly further inland. These counties are predominantly rural and may not have the infrastructure capacity to serve several times the number of average annual incoming migrants.
