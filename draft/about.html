  The idea for this project came about when I began researching how climate change would affect housing in the United States. I stumbled across a recently published article that used machine learning in combination with other migration models to predict net migration by county in the United States by 2100.

  I created this dashboard using the <a href="https://urbaninstitute.github.io/graphics-styleguide/">Urban Institute Data Visualization Style Guide</a> as well as the r packages urbanmapr and urbanthemes which are opensource. I think that they make this page look lovely. I also used shiny, the tidyverse, and gt packages for the web app, data manipulation and tables respectively.

 My name is Cameron Reaves, a junior at Harvard College studying Environmental Science and Public Policy. I am interested in the intersection of policy, technology and the environment, specifically through the lens of sustainable urban development. I am planning on writing a senior thesis on how transportation policy impacted social and environmental outcomes for the city Atlanta, GA.
